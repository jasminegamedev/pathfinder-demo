# Tilemap Pathfinder
Simple pathfinder demo using Unity's built in tilemap tools. It allows the user to draw their own map, and then can generate a path between any two points using a modified version of Dikjstra's Algorithm. It also lets you specify a movement cost, which is the max number of steps you can take.
